Final project by Kyrylo Aleksandrov

This is the final project for QA Automation course.

Webpage being tested - https://new.fophelp.pro/

For E2E UI testing I am using Playwright
For API testing I am using Mocha and Chai (with playwright browser to grab cookies)

To run API tests - npm run test:api
To run UI tests - npm run test:ui
To run API and UI together - npm run test:all
